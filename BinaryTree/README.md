C# Binary Search Tree Implementation
This example shows how to implement a Binary Search Tree using  C#. A tree whose nodes have at most 2 child nodes is called a binary tree. we name them the left and right child because each node in a binary tree can have only 2 children.
A sample binary tree:
binary tree 2


Tree Traversals (PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder)

Traversal is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree. In this example, I implemented three method which we use to traverse a tree.


PreOrder Traversal
InOrder Traversal
PostOrder Traversal
PreOrder Traversal:

Visit the root
Traverse the left subtree
Traverse the right subtree
InOrder Traversal:

Traverse the left subtree
Visit the root
Traverse the right subtree
PostOrder Traversal:


Traverse the left subtree
Traverse the right subtree
Visit the root
